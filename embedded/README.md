# Franzy-Embedded

[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html) embedded Broker.

A good fit with [Franzy](https://github.com/ymilky/franzy), a Kafka client and suite of Kafka libraries from admin to serialization.

## What's in the Box

* Embedded Kafka 0.9+ Broker, fully supporting all configuration parameters.
* Concrete Embedded broker types for those that need or want it and prefer something that isn't a component or can be wrapped in one as desired
     * More control and easy for you to wrap in your own component if you wish
     * Full Kafka Broker lifecycle method
* [Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) specific versions of embedded Broker, for easy DI and integration with component systems
     * A component implementing the standard lifecycle protocol that starts/stops the Kafka broker safely (blocking)
     * A component that can compose the concrete version, if for some reason you prefer it wrapped, or need an example to develop your own
* Schemas for validating Kafka broker configurations (via [Franzy-Common](https://github.com/ymilky/franzy-common)

## Why

* You want to validate your Kafka Broker configurations.
* You need to do unit testing, integration testing, etc. and don't want to fire up a full Kafka cluster.
* You want to mess around with Kafka in a shell, REPL, etc.
* You want to test behaviors of consumers and producers with various broker settings and you don't want to go changing your production or even dev/testing cluster for everyone else.
* You're working in a shared environment and need something isolated to your machine(s) only.
* You tried other Kafka embedded brokers and they have some quirks/issues/etc.
     * Don't work with 0.9+
     * Slow(er)
     * No validation
     * Hide functionality and configuration parameters
* You're using the rest of [Franzy](https://github.com/ymilky/franzy) and you want a good fit.
* You want something that is used by real people.
* You want an embedded server that doesn't depend on some giant project you're including just to get at 1 namespace.

## Docs

* Read the browsable [API](http://ymilky.github.io/franzy-embedded/index.html)
* See the source for some additional comments/docs
* For more about using, validating, and developing schemas, see [Schema](https://github.com/plumatic/schema).

## Notes

* Do not use this to run a production Kafka cluster. This should be obvious and you shouldn't be using Kafka if you thought to do this. You've been warned, now we can be friends.
* You will find more schemas, types, etc. in projects with specific usages, for example producer and consumer-only schemas are in [Franzy](https://github.com/ymilky/franzy) itself.

## Installation

Add the necessary dependency to your project:

```clojure
[clj-kafka.franzy/embedded "0.0.1"]
```

### Requirements

* Zookeeper version supporting Kafka 0.9+, see [Kafka FAQ](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/FAQ)
* Clojure 1.8+ (earlier versions untested, but may work with a recompile)

Ensure you have an available instance of Zookeeper visible to the machine that will run your embedded broker. A common use-case is to also run an embedded instance of Zookeeper or to use a container such as Docker, or a VM/VM-like setup such as Vagrant.

## Usage

Ideally, you should be injecting your configuration via EDN, environment variables, params, etc.

### Startable Broker

For most use-cases, prefer the Startable broker. It requires the least resistance to use and will be more REPL/Unit test friendly.

First, require:

```clojure
(ns my.ns
  (:require [franzy.embedded.broker :as broker]
            [franzy.embedded.protocols :refer :all]))
```

Then, to start a broker and do some work inside a with-open (try/catch/finally close):

```clojure
(with-open [b (broker/make-startable-broker)]
 ;;do terrible things with broker and its friends

 (println "I am doing broker things here, maybe a test, maybe selling someone's pension for pennies."))
```

If you don't have a config or want the standard localhost defaults for both Kafka and Zookeeper, you can just do:

```clojure
(let [b (broker/make-startable-broker)]
  (startup broker)
  ;;broker is running

  ;;signal a shutdown, but may not shutdown for a bit
  (shutdown b)

  ;;stop the broker, blocks until shutdown
  (await-shutdown b)

  ;you can shortcut the above with:
  (attempt-shutdown b))
```

### Typed Broker

If you want to use an embedded broker for a quick server/unit test, you **must** use the startable version of the broker, or else it is up to you to elect partition leaders.

If you see an exception in your logs such as: **LEADER_NOT_AVAILABLE**, this is your problem.

This broker is for slightly lower-level usage and its functionality is wrapped by the startable version. Use this broker only if you need to customize Kafka's behavior with Zookeeper when developing or testing.

With those caveats understood, first require:

```clojure
(ns my.ns
  (:require [franzy.embedded.broker :as broker]
            [franzy.embedded.protocols :refer :all]))
```


Usage is the same as the startable broker, with a few extras contained in the protocols namespace.

If you don't have a config or want the standard localhost defaults for both Kafka and Zookeeper, you can just do:

```clojure
(let [b (broker/make-broker)]
  (startup broker)
  ;;broker is running

  ;;signal a shutdown, but may not shutdown for a bit
  (shutdown b)

  ;;stop the broker, blocks until shutdown
  (await-shutdown b)

  ;you can shortcut the above with:
  (attempt-shutdown b))
```

### Component Broker

First, require:

```clojure
(ns my.ns
  (:require [franzy.embedded.component :as broker]))
```

For the pure startable component version:

```clojure
(let [b (broker/make-embedded-startable-broker)]
  ;;calls startup
  (component/start b)
  ;;The Kafka Server itself
  (:server b)
  ;;blocks and awaits shutdown
  (component/stop b))
```

### Composite Component Broker

First, require:

```clojure
(ns my.ns
  (:require [franzy.embedded.composite :as broker]))
```

For the pure component version:

```clojure
(let [b (broker/make-embedded-broker)]
  ;;calls startup on the concrete broker
  (component/start b)
  ;;The concrete broker
  (:embedded-broker b)
  ;;blocks and awaits shutdown on the concrete broker
  (component/stop b))
```

### Other Fun

Check out the protocols and tests.

A few things supported via protocols on the typed broker:

* Get an instance of zk-utils for the lazy, to use with admin, and even better, [Franzy-Admin](https://github.com/ymilky/franzy-admin)
* Get the bound port per channel, for example SSL or plain
* Play with server state bytes, if you know what that is and what you're doing

### Validation

Validation is performed when you attempt to create a broker. You can validate using the provided schemas in advance if you prefer.

### Config

Configuration is done just using a regular Clojure map. The broker values correspond to the official [broker configs](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#brokerconfigs) to make life easier. All property keys are keywords.

You can use the config codec in [Franzy-Common](https://github.com/ymilky/franzy-common) as well if you want to convert an existing config into EDN.

Here's an example config with a few extra params to demonstrate, but you only need to provide a host name, port, broker id, and zookeeper connection string.

```clojure
{:host.name                            "127.0.0.1"
 :port                                 9092
 :broker.id                            0
 :advertised.host.name "your-insignificant-host.com"
 :advertised.port 9092
 :num.partitions                       1
 :controller.socket.timeout.ms         1500
 :controlled.shutdown.enable           true
 :replica.socket.timeout.ms            1500
 :delete.topic.enable                  true
 :controlled.shutdown.retry.backoff.ms 100
 :log.cleaner.dedupe.buffer.size       2097152
 :zookeeper.connect                    "127.0.0.1:2181"}
```
